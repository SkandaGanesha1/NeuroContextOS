# A Heartfelt Request to the ARM AI Developer Challenge Judges

Dear Judges,

I am writing this with a very heavy heart. A single mistaken terminal command completely wiped out my entire project — the work I had been building, refining, and perfecting for the past two months.  
Both my **local repository** and the **GitHub cloud repo** were erased before I even realized what had happened. I have no remaining code backups to show the full implementation that I had worked so hard on.

This project was not just code to me — it was my passion, my dedication, and a dream I poured my heart into. Losing everything in an instant has been devastating.

But not all hope is lost.

The **only surviving proof of my work** is the set of **AI models I trained, optimized, and fine-tuned specifically for ARM kernels**. These models represent countless hours of experimentation, architecture design, optimization passes, and benchmark testing.

You can access all my surviving trained and optimized models here:

I humbly request you to please evaluate my submission based on:

- The **models I have produced**
- The **core idea and innovation behind my project**
- The commitment and time I have invested into this challenge

I understand that rules and evaluation guidelines are important, but I kindly ask for your compassion and a second chance to prove myself. I am ready to rebuild, re-implement, and demonstrate my work again if you permit it.

Thank you for understanding, and for giving developers like me an opportunity to aspire, learn, and grow.

With sincere respect,
